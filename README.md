# iCARE WEBSITE 

My first CRUD project was the [iCARE Website](https://github.com/julsCadenas/iCARE-Website), originally written in PHP. I am now rewriting it using the MERN tech stack.

## Tech Stack:
### Backend
- MongoDB using the Mongoose library
- Express JS
- Node JS
### Frontend
- React JS
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS

## How to run:
```bash
cd path/to/project
```
### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev 
```
### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev 
```
